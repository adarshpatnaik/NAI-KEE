            <p style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 25px;">DESIGNING:</p>
            <p>Designing at Nike isn’t simply being at the forefront of footwear or reimagining apparel. For our teams, design is a vehicle to communicate and commit to the core tenets of what we stand for: performance, expression, collaboration, inclusion, and sustainability.

                Our designers are curious innovators with open minds, everyday athletes inclusive of all abilities, and visual storytellers with a passion for sport. As a team, our collaborations don’t just generate and accelerate the most progressive creations, but inspire movement, cultivate community, and protect the future. To be a part of Nike Design team doesn’t just take talent, it takes the ability to play as a team, dream as a team, and win as a team.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 25px;">MARKETING:</p>
            <p>Nike is a champion brand builder. Its advertising slogans—“Bo Knows,” “Just Do It,” “There Is No Finish Line”—have moved beyond advertising into popular expression. Its athletic footwear and clothing have become a piece of Americana. Its brand name is as well-known around the world as IBM and Coke.

                So it may come as a surprise that Nike, the consummate marketer, came to understand the importance of marketing late in its life: after it hit the $1 billion revenue mark. After more than a decade of meteoric growth, Nike misjudged the aerobics market, outgrew its own capacity to manage, and made a disastrous move into casual shoes. All of those problems forced the company into a period of intense self-examination. Ultimately, says founder, chairman, and CEO Phil Knight, the company realized that the way forward was to expand its focus from the design and manufacture of the product, where Nike had always excelled, to the consumer and the brand.

                Nike’s roots go back to a company called Blue Ribbon Sports, which Knight, a former runner at the University of Oregon, and Bill Bowerman, Knight’s former track coach, created in 1962. Blue Ribbon Sports started out distributing running shoes for a Japanese company, then shifted to designing its own shoes and outsourcing them from Asia.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 900; font-size: 25px;">AESTHETIC FOOT WEAR:</p>
            <p>Nike, Inc. (stylized as NIKE) is an American athletic footwear and apparel corporation headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, United States. It is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in excess of US$46 billion in its fiscal year 2022.</p>
